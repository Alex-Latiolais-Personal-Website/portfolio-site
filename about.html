        <div class="content"><h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Hailing from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I have pursued my education within the local public school system, including Baton Rouge Magnet High School. Initially enrolled in Louisiana State University (LSU) for computer engineering, I transitioned to a web development bootcamp offered by Fullstack Academy, still in collaboration with LSU. This shift allowed me to focus on my passion for web development while benefiting from the resources and support of LSU. Through this transformative journey, I am well-equipped to thrive in the dynamic field of web development.</p></div>
