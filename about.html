            <div class="content + cleft"><h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>From an early age, my fascination with computers has propelled me to explore the boundless realm of technology. This innate curiosity sparked a passion for coding that has persisted throughout my academic journey, commencing in the nascent years of high school. Over the years, I have cultivated my expertise in various programming languages, including Python, C++, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The art of coding has not only become an integral part of my skill set but also a beloved pastime, particularly when engaged in the intricate intricacies of web development.</p></div>
            
            <div class="content + cright"><h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Hailing from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I have pursued my education within the local public school system, including Baton Rouge Magnet High School. Initially enrolled in Louisiana State University (LSU) for computer engineering, I transitioned to a web development bootcamp offered by Fullstack Academy, still in collaboration with LSU. This shift allowed me to focus on my passion for web development while benefiting from the resources and support of LSU. Through this transformative journey, I am well-equipped to thrive in the dynamic field of web development.</p></div>
